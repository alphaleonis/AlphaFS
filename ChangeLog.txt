Version 1.6

    * New: The public key of AlphaFS.dll has changed, delay-signing is no longer used.

	* New: Unit Tests, also act as code samples.

    * New: Numerous bugfixes and optimizations.

	* New: Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 File(Info) and Directory(Info) classes.

	* New: Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 DriveInfo() class and with UNC support.

	* New: Complete implementation of .NET 4.5 Path() class.
	
	* New: Implemented Unicode aka "Long Path" handling for all Win32 API functions that support it.

	* New: Added support for NuGet.
	
	* New: Added support for building against .NET 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1 in addition to 3.5.

	* New: Supports networking by enumerating hosts and shares (SMB/DFS) and connect/disconnect to/from network resources (AlphaFS.Network.Host() class).
	
	* New: Supports working with NTFS ADS (Alternate Data Streams) on files and directories (AlphaFS.Filesystem.AlternateDataStreamInfo() class).

	* New: Supports enumerating connected PnP devices (AlphaFS.Filesystem.Device() / AlphaFS.Filesystem.DeviceInfo() classes).
	
	* New: Supports extracting icons from files and folders (AlphaFS.Filesystem.Shell32Info() class).
	
	* New: Supports isFullPath parameter for numerous methods to control path normalization. This speeds up things internally
	       (less string processing and GetFullPath() calls) and also enables working with files and directories with a trailing dot or space.

			false (slow)   : (default) Path will be checked and resolved to an absolute path. Unicode prefix is applied.
			true  (fast)   : Path is an absolute path. Unicode prefix is applied.
			null  (fastest): Path is already an absolute path with Unicode prefix. Use as is.

	
	* Mod: Enabled KernelTransaction parameter for all Win32 API functions that support it.

	* Mod: Added public read only properties to class FileSystemInfo()

		Available for: DirectoryInfo() / FileInfo()
			EntryInfo	 : Instance of the FileSystemEntryInfo() class.
			LengthStreams: Retrieves the actual number of bytes of disk storage used by all streams (NTFS ADS).
			LongFullName : The Unicode absolute path of the file system object.
			Transaction  : Represents the KernelTransaction that was passed to the constructor.
	
	* Mod: Refactored Path() class.

	* Mod: Add more reparse point tag entries to enum ReparsePointTag.

	* Breaking
		-Removed classes PathInfoXxx().
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileAccess in favor of System.IO.FileAccess enum.
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileAttributes in favor of System.IO.FileAttributes enum
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileMode in favor of System.IO.FileMode enum
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileOptions in favor of System.IO.FileOptions enum
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileShare in favor of System.IO.FileShare enum
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileSystemRights in favor of System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights enum
		-Removed AlphaFS implementation of enum FileType, now obsolete.

		-Renamed CopyProgressCallbackReason to CopyMoveProgressCallbackReason.
		-Renamed CopyProgressResult to CopyMoveProgressResult.
		-Renamed enum MoveFileOptions to MoveOptions.
		

    
    * New: Added "Cached LazyLoading" to class: FileSystemInfo() improving performance for classes: DirectoryInfo() and FileInfo().


Version 1.5
   * New: Various file system objects enumeration methods in Directory class.
   * Numerous bugfixes and optimizations
   * New: more unit tests
   * New: VS 2010 help file format, aka Help Viewer 1, dumped MS HELP 2 format

Version 1.0
  * New: Directory.GetFileIdBothDirectoryInfo, which provides access to the GetFileInformationByHandleEx Win32 API 
         function with the FileInformationClass set to FileIdBothDirectoryInfo.
  * New: Directory.CountFiles
  * Mod: Additional overloads for File.Open method.
  * Mod: FileAttributes.Invalid flag removed.
  * New: Directory.GetProperties method for retrieving aggregated information about files in a directory.

Version 1.0 Beta
  * New: File.GetFileInformationByHandle added providing information about file index and link count.
  * New: KernelTransaction can now be created from a System.Transaction to participate in the ambient transaction
  * New: File.GetHardlinks providing an enumeration about all hardlinks pointing to the same file.
  * Mod: Many improvements and bug-fixes to Path/PathInfo path-parsing.
  * Mod: More functions for manipulating timestamps on files and directories.
  * Mod: Directory.GetFullFileSystemEntries added to provide more convenient usage of the FileSystemEnumerator.
  * Mod: ... and many more minor changes and fixes.

Version 0.7 alpha
  * New: DirectoryInfo and FileInfo classes added
  * New: PathInfo.GetLongFullPath() and Path.GetLongFullPath() methods added
  * Mod: Path and PathInfo got many bugfixes, and some new functionality was added.
  * Mod: AlphaFS now targets the .NET Framework 2.0 instead of 3.5 previously.
  * Mod: KernelTransaction can now be created from, and participate in a System.Transactions.Transaction.
  * New: BackupFileStream added, in support of the BackupWrite(), BackupRead() and BackupSeek() functions from the Win32 API.
  * Mod: Inheritance structure for several classes was modified, mainly to add MarshalByRefObject to the relevant classes.
  * Mod: FileSystemEntryInfo was changed to a reference type (class) instead of the previous value type (struct).
  * Mod: PathInfo now accepts more types of internal paths, such as \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy5\ etc.
  * ... and many minor changes and fixes, not mentioned here.
